# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At HTTPSnippet, we take security issues very seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to disclose it responsibly. Please report any potential security vulnerabilities to us by sending an email to [vulnerability@konghq.com](mailto:vulnerability@konghq.com).

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the report and will keep you informed of the progress. We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days of confirmation.
- **Disclosure**: We prefer coordinated disclosure and will work with you to schedule the disclosure of the vulnerability in a way that minimizes the risk to users.

## Bug Bounty Program

We encourage security researchers to participate in our bug bounty program as outlined on the [Kong Vulnerability Disclosure](https://konghq.com/compliance/bug-bounty) page. This program provides rewards for discovering and reporting security vulnerabilities in accordance with our disclosure guidelines.

Thank you for helping to keep HTTPSnippet secure.
